<p>
I'm a CS and Data Science student at NYU. 
My passions lie particularly in fullstack development and open source.

I love building web apps because there are so many new things to learn.
I'm good at writing elegant code and working with a team.
Btw, if you want to go to hackathons together or have a cool project idea, feel free to hit me up!
