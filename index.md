I'm studying CS and Data Science at <b>NYU</b>. 
<br/>
It's my 5th year in the U.S. now. I started programming in high school to make cool games and automation.
Now, I mainly work on web dev because I'm excited about how fast it's evolving.
I like to predict what products do people want and think about how to make a positive impact with my skills.
My passions lie particularly in fullstack, open source, and software design patterns.
