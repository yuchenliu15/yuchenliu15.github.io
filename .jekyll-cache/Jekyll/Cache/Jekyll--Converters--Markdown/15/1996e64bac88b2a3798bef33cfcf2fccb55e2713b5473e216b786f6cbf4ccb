I"à<p>Iâ€™m a freshman at NYU, studying CS and Data Science. <br />
                Itâ€™s my 5th year in the U.S. now. Throughout high school I
                completed Calculus 1, 2 and taught myself
                programming languages such as Java and C. Iâ€™m interested in working with others to develop software
                products. My
                passions lie
                particularly in software engineering, blockchain technology, and web design.<br /></p>
