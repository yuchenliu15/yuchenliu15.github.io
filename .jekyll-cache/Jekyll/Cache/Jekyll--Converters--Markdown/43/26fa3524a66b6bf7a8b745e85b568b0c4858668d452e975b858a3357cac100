I"’<p>Iâ€™m a freshman at NYU, studying CS and Data Science.</p>

<p><br />
Itâ€™s my 5th year in the U.S. now. Throughout high school I
completed Calculus 1, 2 and taught myself
programming languages such as Java and C. Iâ€™m interested in working with others to develop software
products. 
My passions lie particularly in software engineering, blockchain technology, and web design.</p>
